title: System Design Roadmap

<div class="message">
  Go through distributed system concepts and then build deeper knowledge base around it.
</div>

Any system design problem is unique but I believe have common starting point. So before even starting to solve a design problem, one must follow the structure/template.

# Components

```mermaid
    A[User-side-interface] <-->| connect| B(Applicaton-Edge)
    B -->|Local state| D[Maintain Caching]
    B -->|Logic| E[Load-balance]
    E <-->|App-Logic-Bigbox| F(logic-functions)
    F--> | Fn-A| G(Func-A)
    B<--> |Authenticate/verify| C(Req-Authentication)
    F--> | Fn-B| H(Func-B)
    G<--> | DB-A| I(Database-A)
    H<--> | DB-B| J(Database-B)
```
