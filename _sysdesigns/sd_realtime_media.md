3500 signals on 8 fiberes between 2 trucks.

-- two: audio and replay.

150-250 people.
graphic-audio-visual
15 cameras in a game.
computer -- winch station --> remote control
mix the video from different sources.
fox sports remote operations. 4k -> 10 times the pixels, get lot more detail. more frame per sec for clear replay.
11 EVS machines -- selling tell producer who has best replay. 
Audio: mixer - crowd in surround sound and announcer in center speaker. Console 96 faders, 192 inputs to manage.
-- very reactive for audio-mixer guy.
